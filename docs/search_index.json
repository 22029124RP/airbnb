Small or large, call out what's incorrect. Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.\nSyntax\n\nUse tabs (four) to indent your code, never use spaces.\nNested elements should be indented once for every level.\nAlways use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.\nMarkup should be XHTML valid for easier integration with Teamsite.\nAlways include a trailing slash in self-closing elements even if the HTML5 spec says they're optional. HTML should be XHTML valid.\nDonâ€™t omit optional closing tags (e.g.  or ).\nNever use IE conditional hacks to include additional style sheets.\n\n\n\n  \n    Page title\n  \n\n  \n    \n    Hello, world!\n  \n\n\nHTML5 doctype\nEnforce standards mode and more consistent rendering in every browser possible with this simple doctype at the beginning of every HTML page.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nLanguage attribute\nFrom the HTML5 spec:\n\nAuthors are encouraged to specify a lang attribute on the root html element, giving the document's language. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronunciations to use, translation tools to determine what rules to use, and so forth.\n\nRead more about the lang attribute in the spec.\nHead to Sitepoint for a list of language codes.\n\n  \n\n\nIE compatibility mode\nInternet Explorer supports the use of a document compatibility  tag to specify what version of IE the page should be rendered as. Unless circumstances require otherwise, it's most useful to instruct IE to use the latest supported mode with edge mode.\nFor more information, read this awesome Stack Overflow article.\n\n\nCharacter encoding\nQuickly and easily ensure proper rendering of your content by declaring an explicit character encoding. When doing so, you may avoid using character entities in your HTML, provided their encoding matches that of the document (generally UTF-8).\n\n  \n\n\nCSS and JavaScript includes\nPer HTML5 spec, typically there is no need to specify a type when including CSS and JavaScript files as text/css and text/javascript are their respective defaults.\nHTML5 spec links\n\nUsing link\nUsing style\nUsing script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  /* ... */\n\n\n\n\n\nPracticality over purity\nStrive to maintain HTML standards and semantics, but not at the expense of practicality. Use the least amount of markup with the fewest intricacies whenever possible.\nAttribute order\nHTML attributes should come in this particular order for easier reading of code.\n\nid, name\nclass\nsrc, for, type, href, value\ndata-*\ntitle, alt\naria-*, role\n\nClasses make for great reusable components, so they come first. Ids are more specific and should be used sparingly (e.g., for in-page bookmarks), so they come second.\n\n  Example link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean attributes\nA boolean attribute is one that needs no declared value. XHTML required you to declare a value, but HTML5 has no such requirement.\nFor further reading, consult the WhatWG section on boolean attributes:\n\nThe presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.\n\nEven though the boolean attributes' value is optional, it's recommended that you use the attribute's canonical name as it's value.\n\n\n\n\n\n  1\n\n\nReducing markup\nWhenever possible, avoid superfluous parent elements when writing HTML. Many times this requires iteration and refactoring, but produces less HTML. Take the following example:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"},"best-practices/css.html":{"url":"best-practices/css.html","title":"CSS","keywords":"","body":"CSS Style Guide\nTOOD\n"},"best-practices/javascript/":{"url":"best-practices/javascript/","title":"JavaScript","keywords":"","body":"SDP JavaScript Style Guide() {\nA mostly reasonable approach to JavaScript\n\nTypes\nReferences\nObjects\nArrays\nDestructuring\nStrings\nFunctions\nArrow Functions\nConstructors\nModules\nIterators and Generators\nProperties\nVariables\nHoisting\nComparison Operators & Equality\nBlocks\nComments\nWhitespace\nCommas\nSemicolons\nType Casting & Coercion\nNaming Conventions\nAccessors\n\n}\n"},"best-practices/javascript/types.html":{"url":"best-practices/javascript/types.html","title":"Types","keywords":"","body":"Types\n\n1.1  Primitives: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.\n\n\nstring\nnumber\nboolean\nnull\nundefined\n\nconst foo = 1;\nlet bar = foo;\n\nbar = 9;\n\nconsole.log(foo, bar); // => 1, 9\n\n\n1.2  Complex: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.\n\n\nobject\narray\nfunction\n\nconst foo = [1, 2];\nconst bar = foo;\n\nbar[0] = 9;\n\nconsole.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9\n\n"},"best-practices/javascript/references.html":{"url":"best-practices/javascript/references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"References\n\n2.1  Use const for all of your references; avoid using var.\n\n\nWhy?
