# ESLint Config Diff

Comparison of changes between ours and airbnb's. Rules have been normalized to the array format for consistent diff formatting.

Base (ours): -----
Comparison (theirs): -----

Changes are presented using the <del>deleted</del> and <ins>inserted</ins> formatting.

## Known differences
These are intentional differences between our style guide and Airbnb's. This list is generated from explicit data defined within [the diff task](../../tasks/diff.js).

{{> diffSection known}}


## Unknown/unmerged differences
These are differences that haven't been previously acknowledged. They may be changes we aren't aware of or simply
upstream changes that haven't been merged yet. Any differences listed here that we _are_ aware of
should be added to the list in [the diff task](../../tasks/diff.js) to remove them from here.
