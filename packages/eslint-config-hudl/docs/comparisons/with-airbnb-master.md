# ESLint Config Diff (vs Airbnb v5.0.0)

Comparison of changes between ESLint configs. This is the computed result of the source config, including the effects of any extended configs. Changes are presented using the <del>deleted</del> and <ins>inserted</ins> formatting.
 Rules have been normalized to the array format for consistent diff formatting. Non-rule settings are also currently displayed within an array (for rendering simplicity).

Base (starting point): [../../index.js](../../index.js)
