# ~~Airbnb~~ ascribe JavaScript Style Guide() {

## Introduction
At ascribe we write a lot of JavaScript and value quality code.
Since all of us liked [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), we figured that we can just fork it and change it to our needs.

## Approach
As we want everyone in the team to be able to take part in the creation of this style guide, we decided to have it reviewed and transformed to our specific needs.
This is why we're going to remove all the contents of this document, to add them bit-by-bit again through a process of pull-requests and reviews.
Depending on how fast the review will be, every other day there will be a new pull request for everyone to read and comment on.

As for adjusting the linters, we still need to figure out a way on how to change them efficiently. So if you have suggestions, come forward.
